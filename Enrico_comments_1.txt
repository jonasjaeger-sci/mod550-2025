Git repo: it works, a bit too many files and over-engineered (one folder for one task is too much, it makes it more complicate to check it out). This structure would be great for large tasks.
Are all those requirements needed?

Readme.md: That is good. 

Task 1.1: 

Task 1.2: good, very drammatic colors also :) 

Task 1.3: Nice

Task 1.4: Good and Good subplot also.

Task 1.5: Good visualization too!

Comment:
Good good. 
In general, It is easier to have a notebook with the task1.1, task1.2 etc with some comments that uses, as you already have, the classes/function saved elsewhere. 

To get a detailed feedback on your coding style, install pylint. (pip install pylint). Then run it to get your code evaluated (the .py part) and some tips on how to improve (pylint mod_550_project_1.py)
